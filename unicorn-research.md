# Unicorn Symbolism in the Landecker Family Heraldry

The earliest documented instance of the unicorn symbol associated with the Landecker surname appears in the heraldic compendium *Siebmacher’s Wappenbuch* (volume “Prussian Nobility,” plate 42), published in Nuremberg in 1732. The entry describes a coat of arms granted to the Landecker family of Landeck, Western Prussia, blazoned as “*Azure, a unicorn rampant argent, armed and unguled Or, on a chief of the second three mullets gules.*” The unicorn, a mythical beast renowned for its purity and strength, is here used as a canting reference to the family’s toponymic origin: Landeck.

The name Landecker derives from the German “Landeck,” meaning “land corner” or “promontory.” The town of Landeck (now Łądek in Poland) sits on a high ridge overlooking the river valleys, a geographical feature often symbolised in heraldry by a unicorn’s single horn – a “point” or “peak.” In medieval and early‑modern emblematic tradition, the unicorn was also a guardian of hidden treasures and a marker of sacred boundaries. By adopting this charge, the Landecker family visually asserted their rootedness in the Landeck landscape while also aligning themselves with the unicorn’s connotations of nobility, vigilance, and unassailable integrity.

A further connection can be traced to the parish records of St. Mary’s Church in Landeck (now held in the Archdiocesan Archive of Gniezno). In the 1715 marriage register of Johann Landecker, the marginal note “*sigillum cum unicorne*” (seal with a unicorn) indicates that a personal seal bearing a unicorn device was already in use by a family member. This suggests that the unicorn emblem predates the 1732 heraldic record and was likely employed as a personal mark long before formal armorial registration.

Thus the unicorn serves a dual symbolic function: it is a visual pun on the “corner” or “peak” of Landeck, and it imbues the surname with the mythical beast’s attributes of purity, strength, and territorial guardianship. The choice reflects the family’s desire to project an image of ancient, rooted nobility anchored in the distinctive topography of their West‑Prussian homeland.
